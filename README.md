# SkinLib
An object oriented set of classes/structs aiming to replace Max's SkinOps.

### Classes/Structs

- SkinModifier    - Main interface
- SkinBone        - Bone representation (bone_id, list_id, etc..)
- SkinVertex      - Vertex representation (id, influencing bones, etc..)
- SkinVertexBone  - Vertex local bone representation 
- SkinHelpers     - Some helper functions to work with 3dsmax Skins
- SkinModifierOps - Regular SkinOps functions are available as methods from here!

The code is **documented** using NaturalDocs, see doc/index.html for a very draft documentation
***SkinLib*** is very wip! Large parts are to be implemented, any help is appreciated!
